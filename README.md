# UCAR PeopleThis is a repo for managing machine readable artifacts for the [UCAR People APIs](https://wiki.ucar.edu/display/peopledb/People+REST+API). The goal is to maintain and evolve an OpenAPI, Postman Collection, and APIs.json index for the [UCAR People APIs](https://wiki.ucar.edu/display/peopledb/People+REST+API).They are a constant work in progress, and will be updated on a regular basis when new information is added, or more of the specifications are supported.Feel free to submit a pull request to evolve any of the artifacts, and leave GitHub issues if you have any questions, comments, or feedback.- [Website](https://wiki.ucar.edu/display/peopledb/People+REST+API)- [Developer](https://wiki.ucar.edu/display/peopledb/People+REST+API)- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/UCAR_News)The [APIs.json](https://github.com/api-evangelist/ucar-people/blob/master/apis.json) index provides links to all the relevant links for the UCAR People APIs, including the OpenAPI and Postman if they are present.
